# My Site, Made Mostly (95%) by Copilot

I rolled my Rails site to Nuxt 3 + Nuxt Content and had so, so much fun! Wanted to share this with you...

## Concerns

- "It's going to cost jobs"
- "There will be no more senior developers / erosion of skills"
- "The code generated sucks (hallucinations, incorrect, buggy) and no one will know that"
- "Blind trust and detachment" (aka the new Copy/Paste from StackOverflow, but easier)
- "It can't possibly understand the domain I'm working in"
