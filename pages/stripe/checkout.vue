              worked very hard on this stuff. If you know someone that
              <i>really needs the help</i> go ahead, I'll trust you. Or you can
              let me know (reply to this email) and I'll do what I can for them.

                    expired. That's OK, however, I'll send you an email with a
                    link right not - just press the button below. I do this to
