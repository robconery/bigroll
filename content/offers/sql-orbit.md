# Learn the one skill that will save you hours, and even your job

Do you struggle with your data access tools and run up against problems that you just can't solve? Maybe you have a "data person" or "SQL freak" at your work that jumps in to save the day when your database grinds to a halt.

These people are extremely valuable and for a very good reason: **they can quite literally save the company from going under**.

## It's Not a Problem Until It's a Problem, Right?

We learn as programmers not to "prematurely optimize" our code, and that most of the problems we dream up won't actually happen. Some of this is true, except when it's not.

Databases tend to bear the brunt of this thinking. In the early days of a project or a company, everything is typically fine. After a year or two, things begin to slow down and you need to scale. No big deal!

But then strange things begin to happen::

- Backups start to fail.
- Customers report timeouts and your logs show sporadic connection errors.
- Your servers run out of RAM during replication.

That's when you hear that all-too familiar manager's refrain:

> Looks like we need a database person to help us out

## Programmers Hate SQL Until They Need to Know It

It's something I've never understood: **why do programmers hate SQL so much**? Is it aesthetics? If so, I can understand that - SQL isn't terribly pretty to look at or to decipher... but the things that it can do are much more important.

Maybe it's the fact that learning SQL can be a chore - online courses typically have you creating DVD stores and learning dry syntax rules that are boring and have absolutely no real-world applicability.

Or maybe it's just what they've heard or read, constantly, from other developers who are just perpetuating one of the most ridiculous ideas in computer science. _SQL is a fantastic investment in your career_, and by knowing it, you could quite literally save the day when your server is in flames.

## Your Hero's Journey

I won't try to convince you that SQL is awesome - it's not. **It's an old, clunky language** that's difficult to read and even harder to write given the strange syntax rules. But if you take just a weekend and learn it, **your career will change forever**.

That's not hyperbole - it's happened to everyone who has become the "database person" on their project. Programmer's fear of SQL pushes them to do absolutely anything to avoid dealing with SQL, which includes asking you to solve the problem they're having.

Let them. **It makes you extremely valuable**.

## These Skills are Always In Demand

It might be hard to believe but SQL consistently ranks in the **top 10 programming languages**, even though it's not a programming language! It's ahead of languages like Go, Swift and Ruby - consistently! That's because SQL people are always needed!

**People do horrible things with data** and spreadsheets, introducing errors, bias and often data that's simply trash. Being able to "sense" these issues and then correct them can save your company millions of dollars, making you look like the badass you are.

I bought your first book in 2016 or 2017. Loved it because of the videos back then. Bought the interview prep videos on your website recently as well. Your books over the years, videos, and a little bit of leetcode... plus my 10 years of experience **got me a job at AWS the first time through**.

Back then, your first book got me over the imposter syndrome I had. Being self-taught, I had a lot of doubts, coupled with being a javascript developer and getting a lot of flack from backend engineering. That's all noise now to me, **I know my worth**. Have for a while. Now I try to help others see that too.

## Real Data, Real Fun

You'll be given the **raw data that Cassini gathered** during its time orbiting Saturn and passing by Enceladus. You're going to load this data, transform it into a solid **relational design** using PostgreSQL, and then export it for **analysis** by the analytical team. When you're done, you'll be able to **create tables and views**, run analytical queries and tweak data as needed. You'll be on your way to **your new life as a data pro**
