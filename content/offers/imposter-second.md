# Don't Have a CS Degree and Feel Like You Should?

Take a look around your office. 80% of your colleagues are silently stuck in crappy jobs earning far less than they should be. The other 20% are planning their exit to higher-paying positions this year. What's the difference? The 20% know their worth and aren't afraid to speak up. This book helps you join them.

## You're Not Alone, Friend

This industry is full of people just like you and me who don't have formal CS degrees, and it sucks to feel like you don't belong. Like you're an imposter. I've been there, constantly nodding along to discussions about algorithms and data structures while silently panicking inside.

I really recommend Rob Conery's The Imposter's Handbook as a great way to reinforce those fundamentals and core concepts. Rob has been programming for years but without a CS degree. This book is about all the things he learned and all the gaps that got filled in while he was overwhelmed."

## Dunning-Kruger is Real and You're Being Overlooked

You've probably heard of this phenomenon: people with low ability at a task overestimate their skills. Put another way: the worst programmers are the most confident. The opposite is also true: the best performers (likely you) underestimate their skill because they're good people who don't like to shine the light on themselves.

This is the problem: you stay silent while your loud, toxic coworker gets the promotion and you end up working for them. Great programmers are a rare find - mostly because they stay hidden in crappy jobs, burying their talent under a belief that everyone is better than them. Burnout sets in, self-esteem drops, and they give up entirely.

Just finished reading The Imposter's Handbook, it was so good I couldn't put it down.

## There's Simply Too Much Mediocrity

I spent years teaching myself the subjects that go into a Computer Science degree. I looked at the curriculum for Stanford and MIT (and a few others) and dove in. I studied Computation, Complexity Theory, Cryptography, Algorithms and Data Structures, Lambda Calculus and more.

Instead of a wall of theoretical text, I did my best to make these concepts as human as possible, with hand-drawn sketches of complex topics that took me days (and sometimes months) to figure out. I wanted to write a technical book for humans that would convey the magic of our industry.

## In 2014 I Decided to Write The Imposter's Handbook

Finally taking the time to backfill the computer science concepts that I had always wanted to learn - and it's been the absolute highlight of my career! I've sold over 20,000 copies to date, helping developers just like you all over the world.

This second edition builds on everything from the first, refining explanations, adding new topics, and making everything more accessible and practical for self-taught programmers.

## What Others Are Saying

I've been refining, improving, and polishing this book since I released it in 2016. Over 20,000 copies have been sold to date, all through this site, right here.

OK, before you get recommended all the knuths, cracking the coding interviews or algoexpert/leetcode, let me just have a chance at saving you. Love this book, because it starts from scratch and builds knowledge floor by floor.

::testimonial-small{name="Anna Doma≈Ñska-Grzyb" image="anna.jpg"}
I'm reading The Imposter's Handbook by @robconery with a flushed face and I'm not sure whether I could be even more excited. It's like visiting Hogwarts to me (but with real magic).

I am a transitioning Marine trying to pivot back to software development after a 21 year career. I am working on refreshing my coding skills and found your book, The Imposter's Handbook. I am loving it, and wanted to thank you for taking the time to update it too... you're an inspiration and I'm just loving your book.

YOU KNOW WHAT'S BADASS? When someone continues improving a product well after they've collected your money, and makes the updates available to you super easily. Hats off to @robconery and The Imposter's Handbook. Awesome demonstration of character.

I am being schooled right now and it feels like good! I cannot recommend this too much for people like myself who never went to college for compsci but wishing for proper understanding of significant concepts

## What You'll Learn

Learning core Computer Science concepts _is not_ a purely academic exercise. You will soon begin to connect concepts and ideas together - thing you never thought were related - and a whole new fascinating world will be open to you.

<div class="row g-4">

    ::feature-card{image="/images/doodles/heaps.jpg" title="Data Structures and Algorithms"}
    You'll understand data structures and algorithms so you can optimize your code and pass technical interviews, which means you'll finally feel
    ::


    ::feature-card{image="/images/doodles/bitshift.jpg" title="Binary and Cryptography"}
    You'll learn binary, cryptography, encoding and compression so you can grasp fundamental computing concepts, which means you'll speak more authoritatively about technical decisions
    ::

    ::feature-card{image="/images/doodles/complexity.jpg" title="Computation, Complexity, and Machines"}
    You'll explore computation, complexity theory, and state machines so you won't try to code something impossible, which means avoiding career-damaging mistakes like I made in 2010
    ::

    ::feature-card{image="/images/doodles/di.jpg" title="Software Principles and Patterns"}
    You'll understand software design patterns and principles so you'll have options when architecting complex systems, which means you'll be the one leading the team
    ::

    ::feature-card{image="/images/doodles/2nf_sm.jpg" title="Databases and Data Theory"}
    You'll learn core database theory and relational modeling so you can build proper databases that protect your data, which means your company can make better decisions and make more money
    ::

    ::feature-card{image="/images/doodles/unix_cli.jpg" title="Unix and The Command Line"}
    You'll master essential Unix skills and shell scripting so you can automate your workflow, which means you won't waste hours doing the same jobs manually

## Who Am I to Be Showing You This Stuff?

I'm Rob Conery and **I've been building software for over 25** years without a CS degree. I've created applications for huge corporations including Ameritech and Southwest Bell. I've contracted to Visa, Google, Starbucks and PayPal - creating their very first developer portal back in 2005.

I wrote an open source e-commerce site for Microsoft that was demoed on stage by Steve Ballmer at Tech Ed, Microsoft's biggest developer conference (now //Build). In 2009 I cofounded Tekpub, specializing in high-quality video productions focused on technology. We were acquired by Pluralsight in 2013.

I am obsessed with creating compelling, high-quality books and videos and have been doing so for years.
