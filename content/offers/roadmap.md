# Learning to Code Is Just the Beginning

There's a rush that comes over you when you ship software that brings real value. That magic moment when you deliver something that makes an impact! If you're going to move up, however, **you need master much more than coding.**

## Coding Is Fun, But I Know Something Better

Solving a problem after a day of coding is extremely rewarding - especially when you solve a really intense bug.

You know what's more rewarding than that? **Shipping** and being the one responsible for providing the structure and clarity to help your team be the best they can be.

As a senior developer or project lead, **you have to know your tools and processes**. Source control management, Agile practices, container orchestration, how to test correctly, and how to debug a crashing application in a very short amount of time.

These skills are cultivated over time, and if you're lucky, you have a lead who is showing you how to do these things, hopefully the right way. **If you're unlucky, like I was, you're teaching yourself, learning on the fly. If that's you, then this book is for you**.

## More Than Just Coding Skills

GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Agile methodologies, architecture patterns, monitoring systems... As you look to grow your career, you're suddenly expected to master all these tools and processes.

But how?

Yes, there are books and courses you can buy on each subject - but _none_ of them give you the _why_. It's more than just "we need to maximize our build quality" - it's how you navigate other people and ensure that your strategy is the one that's used.

## The Anxiety of Not Knowing What You Don't Know

That constant worry in the back of your mind - what if they find out I'm figuring this out as I go? What if I make a critical mistake because I missed some fundamental knowledge? What if I can't deliver when it really counts? That imposter feeling isn't just uncomfortable; it's holding you back from the senior positions and responsibilities you deserve.

## Learning the Hard Way

I had to learn how to ship professional software the hard way. As a CTO three times over, running multi-million dollar projects for Fortune 50 clients, I've made every mistake in the book. I had to teach myself source control management, deployment pipelines, container orchestration, proper testing methods, and how to debug critical systems under pressure.

If I had a book that was written in human terms, with images that were clear and language that was friendly, it would have saved me days, if not _weeks_ of pain.

Yes, learning the hard way can be useful for retaining information, but it can also be scarring - leading to burnout and frustration.

## If You Want to Move Up, This Book Is For You

After three years of writing and distilling everything I've learned, I've created the guide I wish I had 25 years ago. This isn't just another coding book - it's a comprehensive guide to becoming a professional software developer who can confidently ship production code and lead teams to success.

But it's more than that.

You can't move up unless you take the time to have a plan in place for _other people_. Success is a magnet, and puts a target on your back. You don't have to learn social skill - you simply need to understand the rules by which many professionals operate.

After 2 years of self-teaching and 1 year on the job, I still felt like I was faking it. This book filled in all those professional gaps my bootcamp never covered. Last month I was promoted to team lead!

Worth every penny. The GitHub workflows section alone saved my team countless hours of confusion and helped us standardize our approach.
