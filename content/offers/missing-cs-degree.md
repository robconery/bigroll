# Stop Feeling Like An Impostor In Your Own Career

Every day, brilliant developers like you hit invisible walls because they don't have a CS degree and think they need one. Those moments when technical terms fly over your head and you wonder if there's a secret handshake everyone learned but you. We've all felt this way and **today this will end for you**.

## You're Great at What You Do, But Something's Missing

You've taught yourself to code with the determined persistence of someone trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the instructions. You've built projects, maybe even landed a job. You're solving real-world problems and shipping code every day.

But in meetings, when colleagues casually toss around terms like "cyclomatic complexity," "binary trees," or "dynamic programming" as if they're discussing the weather, you feel that familiar knot in your stomach. That voice in your head whispers: _"Am I a fraud? Do I really belong here? Is everyone about to discover I've just been frantically Googling everything for years?"_

You're not alone. Thousands of self-taught developers share this exact feeling, silently mouthing "I'll look that up later" while confidently nodding through discussions about algorithmic complexity.

## The Self-Taught Developer's Dilemma

Without a formal CS education, you're missing pieces of the puzzle that others take for granted:

- You struggle to optimize your code beyond "it works on my machine"
- Technical interviews feel like facing a foreign language exam
- You hesitate to contribute to architectural discussions for fear of not understanding the patterns
- Career advancement seems blocked by knowledge gaps you can't easily identify
- That persistent imposter syndrome follows you, day after day

This isn't just uncomfortable—it's holding back your career and costing you opportunities. Each day that passes with these gaps unfilled is another day you're not reaching your full potential.

## I've Been There and Hated It

I got hired at Microsoft in 2006 and was asked to join a strategy meeting on my first day. I had flown in the night before and was completely jet lagged, and also 10 minutes late. Around the table were my coding heroes - people I followed online and whose books I read.

I didn't say a word.

In 2011 I was at a work party and my colleagues were debating `O(log n)` vs. `O(n)` and why one was preferable over another. I had been successfully delivering multi-million dollar projects for Fortune 50 companies for over 17 years at that point... and I had no idea what my coworkers were on about.

And then one of the raised a glass and proclaimed "COMP-SCI BABY!" and I slowly backed out of the room...

## The Solution: A CS Education Designed For Working Developers

I spent all of 2013 and 2014 researching what I didn't know, following the open curriculum from MIT and Stanford, and diving in to the deep end. YouTube videos of class lectures, text books, articles... I was a vacuum!

In 2016 I released _The Imposter's Handbook_, a culmination of my studies and, as of this date, have sold 10s of thousands of copies, totaling well over 7 figures.

**But I didn't stop there**. There was so much to refine, so much more to dig through. I began outlining a second book immediately and videos to go along with both... and I kept going.

That's what you're reading about now: I've distilled everything I have learned learned into "The Missing CS Degree": a comprehensive course specifically designed for self-taught programmers who want to rid themselves of Imposter Syndrome and finally feel like they're catching up with the conversation.
