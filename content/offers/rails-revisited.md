# Remember When Web Development Was Actually Fun?

In a world of JavaScript fatigue and framework churn, there's something refreshingly rebellious about returning to a technology that just lets you build things. Ruby on Rails: no configuration hell, no dependency nightmares, just pure, productive joy.

## Drowning in a Sea of JavaScript Frameworks?

You've been there. We all have. Another day, another JavaScript framework to learn. Another migration strategy to plan. Another set of best practices that will be obsolete by the time you finish reading them. Meanwhile, all you really want to do is build something useful without spending weeks configuring your development environment.

## The Modern Web Development Paradox

The promise of modern web development was productivity. Instead, we got complexity. We've somehow convinced ourselves that spending 80% of our time configuring build tools and managing dependencies is just "the cost of doing business."

We've normalized the absurdity of needing three different package managers, a bundler with 200 plugins, and a dissertation-length configuration file just to render "Hello World" on a screen. The irony is that while we chase the next shiny framework, we're actually building less and enjoying it less too.

## The Hidden Cost of Framework Fatigue

This endless cycle doesn't just waste your time—it kills your creativity and passion for the craft. It transforms the joy of building into the drudgery of configuring. It replaces the satisfaction of shipping with the anxiety of keeping up.

And the real cost? How many brilliant web applications were never built because their creators got stuck in dependency hell? How many weekends were lost to webpack configuration instead of creating something that matters? How many developers have slowly forgotten why they fell in love with web development in the first place?

## My Own Return to Rails

A few months ago, I needed to rebuild my site. I started doing what everyone does these days: researching the latest JavaScript frameworks, comparing build tools, setting up a complex frontend architecture.

Three days in, staring at a terminal displaying an endless cascade of npm errors, a thought hit me like a bolt of lightning: "I haven't written a single line of actual business logic yet." Three days of setup, zero days of building. Something was profoundly wrong with this picture.

That's when I remembered how it felt to build with Rails in the early days. How you could go from idea to working prototype in hours, not weeks. How the framework got out of your way and let you focus on what made your application unique.

## The Frontend Framework Treadmill

For years, I convinced myself that the constant churn was worth it. That learning React, then Vue, then Angular, then back to React with hooks, then Svelte—it was all necessary to stay "current."

But what if current doesn't mean better? What if we've been optimizing for the wrong things? What if the best way forward is actually to step back and reconsider what made web development joyful in the first place?

I realized I had been running hard just to stay in place, chasing frameworks that promised developer happiness but delivered complexity instead.

## And That's When I Rediscovered Rails

And that's when I decided to rebuild my entire site with Ruby on Rails—not out of nostalgia, but out of a genuine desire to be productive again.

What I rediscovered blew me away. Rails hadn't been standing still. It had matured, evolved, and quietly incorporated modern patterns while staying true to its "convention over configuration" roots. Hotwire, Stimulus, and Turbo brought reactive interfaces without the complexity. ActiveStorage simplified file handling. And that magical Rails productivity? It hadn't gone anywhere.

In just one weekend, I accomplished more with Rails than I had in weeks of frontend framework wrangling. The experience was so transformative that I documented every step of my journey rebuilding my site with Rails 7—from initial setup to deployment—so other developers could rediscover this joy too.

## What You'll Discover in "Rails Revisited"

- **Build a complete, modern Rails 7 application from scratch** so you can see exactly how all the pieces fit together, which means you'll be confidently creating your own apps within days, not months
- **Master Hotwire, Stimulus, and Turbo** so you can create reactive, dynamic interfaces without complex JavaScript frameworks, which means spending less time on plumbing and more time on features
- **Learn the "Rails Way" philosophy** that has stood the test of time so you can leverage conventions that eliminate boilerplate code, which means shipping features 5-10x faster than with other frameworks
- **See exactly how I rebuilt my own production site** step by step so you can follow along with real-world decisions, which means learning not just the how but the why behind each architecture choice
- **Understand how modern Rails integrates with CSS frameworks** like Tailwind so you can build beautiful interfaces without fighting your tools, which means creating polished UIs without the usual pain

### What Others Are Saying

> "Rails Revisited convinced me to build my SaaS startup with Rails instead of the Next.js stack I was planning to use. Six months later, we're live with paying customers, and I'm convinced we would still be configuring webpack if I'd gone the JavaScript route." — **Alex K., Founder**

> "As someone who started with JavaScript and had never used Rails before, I was skeptical about learning what seemed like a 'legacy' framework. This course changed everything for me. Now I reach for Rails first for any new project because I know I can actually finish what I start." — **Sarah L., Full Stack Developer**

> "I've been watching the 'death of Rails' being predicted for a decade while quietly building and shipping profitable applications with it. Rob's course perfectly captures why Rails is still the most productive way to build for the web in 2025." — **Michael F., Senior Developer**
