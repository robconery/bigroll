In the first video of this production we addressed risk and whether solo contracting was something that was right for you. This video should help you figure that out a bit more.

You can't get work if you don't know people, hopefully that's obvious by now. But how do you get to know people? For many of us who are introverts, this is kind of hard. There are some strategies we can use, however, to grow our business network, which is exactly what we're doing! It's not about going out and making friends (though, yes, that will hopefully happen too) - it's about reaching out and making sure people know you're awesome and available for work!
