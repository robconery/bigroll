In the previous video in this series we took a look at networking and how to get to word out about your business. Getting out there is only the first step, however, you've got to impress people.

I'm not talking about buying a new wardrobe, although feel free because I happen to like nice clothes... they make me happy :). I'm talking about the small details that really impress potential clients like having a business card, a professional-looking blog and a business email address.

It takes some time, but it lets people know you're serious and that you have an eye for detail. That's important to people who are going to pay you to write code for them!
