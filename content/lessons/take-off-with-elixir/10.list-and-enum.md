### Four Important Friends

There are three Elixir modules that you'll use most often when working with lists of data: `Enum`, `List` and `Keyword`:

 - `Enum` does enumeration functions. Mapping data, filtering, finding, grouping... things like that. This module is *absolutely fundamental*; get to know it!
 - `List` handles list-specific operations whereas `Enum` will work with anything that you iterate over (or that is *enumerable*). Inserting, deleting, first and last - the `List` module is another that you'll want to know well.
 - As you might suspect, `Keyword` does a lot of what `List` does, but for keyword lists.

In addition to these, Elixir supports *list comprehensions*. This is syntactic sugar for iterating over enumerable structures, but comes with built-in filters and the unique ability to have more than one generator.  We'll get to these last - they can be quite complicated.
