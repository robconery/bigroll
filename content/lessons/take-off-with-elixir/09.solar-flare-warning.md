The new CTO just sent me a note. Read this:

```
  Please stop by at 13:20 today; I need to make sure I understand your team's progress. Please bring your little project with you and whatever code works.
  -- Sara
```


*Little project*. Wow. *Your team's progress* - she's the CTO! Could she make this any more obvious? I've had a few interactions with Sara over the years; she used leave snarky comments on my blog and ... well let's just say I was *rather direct* in my replies. I don't think it's a stretch to say that she would seriously love to fire me.

I'm sorry I dragged you into this, but I guess that's life in a startup. For some reason I thought aerospace would be a little less cutthroat. Anyway *we have work to do* or I might be shown the door very soon. *No pressure...*
