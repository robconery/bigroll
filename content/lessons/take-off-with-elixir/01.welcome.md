Welcome to Red:4 - *Where the Future Starts Yesterday*. Blah blah blah we hope you like it here blah blah... We don't have a lot of time so let's just get to it shall we?

##  Getting Set Up

If you don't have Elixir installed, [please do so now](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html). Installing the language is very, very simple so we went spend too much time on it.

Once that's done, check to be sure you have it setup right:

```sh
iex
```

You should see something that looks like this:

```
Erlang/OTP 18 [erts-7.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Interactive Elixir (1.1.1) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```

Don't worry if you don't know what it means. You'll see a lot that won't make sense - for now *let it wash over you*. If this doesn't work for you read up on the docs.

## Questions? Issues? We Have a Discussion Board

I set up [a discussion board](https://github.com/bigmachine-io/taking-off/discussions) for this course up at GitHub so please feel free to drop by and leave a note.
