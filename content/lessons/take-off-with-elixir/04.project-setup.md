You can think of Mix as your Elixir Utility Belt. It builds your projects, runs tasks for you, runs your tests, installs packages - a fascinating tool. That comes later - right now open up your terminal and navigate to a directory where you can save your work.

This is one of many projects you'll be creating so make a `redfour` directory on your drive somewhere.

```elixir
mix new physics
```

You should see some stuff splash on your screen:

```
* creating README.md
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/physics.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/physics_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd physics
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
```

As you can see Mix created the skeleton of an application for you. There are different ways to think about this structure - as a package that's part of a library or as an app in its own right. Right now don't worry about it we'll get to that later.
