### Have To Start Like This: Good Tests

When you focus on small, simple functions as you've seen me do, you make life easy on yourself - especially when it comes to debugging. I've found that the easiest thing to do is just write more tests - even if you comment them out later on.

Testing the little stuff will ultimately lead you to the source of the trouble, and having tests in place is almost always a good thing! All that said, let's look at a handful of situations you may run into, and see if I can't save you some frustration and bloody knuckles. I need you writing code, not figuring out the quirks of Elixir's unit testing library!

### Undefined Function

You will bang your head on this one many times. In the download material you will notice that it does not compile:

```
** (CompileError) test/compiler_problem_test.exs:5: undefined function round_to/2
```

This is a *compilation error* which tells you (of course) that the compiler couldn't find a function you invoked. Having a look at the code, do you see the issue?

```elixir
defp round_to(val, precision) when is_float(val) do
  Float.round(val, precision)
end
```

The function is *private*. This error happens to me often because I typically set "helper functions" as private. In this case, I moved this function to its own module (from `Physics.Rocketry` to `Converter`) and forgot to make it public by switching from `defp` to `def`.
