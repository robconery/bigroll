We just got a new CTO, she arrived a few weeks after I got the job. She doesn't like me... which I guess isn't all that surprising."

Look I'll be honest: you and I are in a battle for our jobs. When you were brought on board I thought we had this Elixir project all sewn up but then we get a new CTO who happens to love .NET and would like nothing more than for us to fail.

I hate to put you in this position, but I think you have what it takes. *Prove me right*. Now let's write some code.

### Organizing the Project

Open up the Physics project in your favorite editor. We need to create a module that will contain the functions we'll need to calculate Escape Velocity (E<sub>V</sub>). Let's call ours `rocketry`:

```
touch lib/physics/rocketry.ex
```

Every app in Elixir is made up of smaller apps and modules. Organizing these modules can be tricky, but an agreed-upon rule is that you have an "entry module" with the same name as your app. This typically goes in the `lib` directory. The modules that you write for your app go in a directory with the same name.

Now let's define our module:

```elixir
defmodule Physics.Rocketry do
  #code here
end
```

Here I've defined a `namespace` for the module that follows the structure of our directories. The .NET and Java people will find this a familiar thing. Using namespaces helps keep modules organized.
