This problem has been solved (rather elegantly I might add) over 2200 years ago by a chap named Eratosthenes. His algorithm is so elegant that just about anyone can understand it. In mathematical terms, his algorithm uses a [sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_theory) to filter and extract the numbers in a set:

> Sieve theory is a set of general techniques in number theory, designed to count, or more realistically to estimate the size of, sifted sets of integers. The primordial example of a sifted set is the set of prime numbers up to some prescribed limit X.

How would you solve this problem? Also: *would you consider this dynamic programming*? Weâ€™ll answer the latter question at the very end.

## The Code

```js
//Sieve of Eratosthenes
const sieve = (n) => {
  var grid = {};
  for (var i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    grid[i]={marked: false};
  }
  const limit = Math.sqrt(n);
  for (var i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {
    for(var x = i + i; x <= n; x += i){
      grid[x].marked = true;
    }
  }
  var out =[];
  for (var i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if(!grid[i].marked) out.push(i);
  }
  return out;
};
console.log(sieve(100));
```
