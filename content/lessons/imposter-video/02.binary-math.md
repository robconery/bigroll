There are a lot of things that I don't know in Computer Science but if there was a King of Things I Don't Know, it would be "binary stuff". I was so scared of this topic that I avoided it completely with the first Imposter's Handbook.

You're about to see why. This is stuff (to me, at least) is simplistically mind-bending! I understand how to add and how to carry numbers - and it makes sense that you should be able to translate that directly to binary... and you can! 

And then... things get a bit more difficult. I did my best with this video to make things as clear and simple as I could - I hope you enjoy.
