I've used hashes for a long time and had a general understanding of what they do... but that's about it. I knew I needed to hash passwords (and other secure data) if I was going to store them in my database... but that's about all. 

I was never sure which algorithms to use nor why... so I dug in and found out. That's the first part of this video.

The second is asymmetric encryption: encoding with a public key and decoding with a second, private key. Absolutely ground-breaking idea! The math is amazingly straightforward too... although I will admit to struggling to explain some of it.

## The Code

To produce a simple hash using Node:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256")
.update("hi")
.digest("hex");

console.log(hash);
```

Hashing a password with PBKDF2 using a million rounds to slow things down:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

const hashPassword = function(pw){
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    crypto.pbkdf2(pw,"super-secret-salt",1000000,32,"sha512", function(err, buffer){
      if(err) reject(err);
      else resolve(buffer.toString("hex"))
    });
  })
}

```

Hashing using scrypt, assigning a cost:

```js
const hashPassword = function(pw){
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    crypto.scrypt(pw,"super-secret-salt",32, {cost: 2**14}, function(err, buffer){
      if(err) reject(err);
      else resolve(buffer.toString("hex"))
    });
  })
}
```

Creating a checksum using MD5:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const fs = require("fs");

const data = fs.readFileSync("./message.txt");

const checksum = function(data){
  return crypto.createHash("md5").update(data, "utf8").digest("hex")
}

console.log(checksum(data));
```

A super-simple mining operation (meant for demonstration only) for blockchain stuff:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

const createHash = (block) => {
  //need to pass a string to our 
  const hashValue = JSON.stringify(block)
  return crypto.createHash("sha256")
  .update(hashValue)
  .digest("base64");
}

const mine = (block, difficulty = 2) => {
  let found = false, start = new Date().getTime();
  //we're looking for a string of 0s so let's create the pattern
  //I could use Regex but I'm not that good
  const lookingFor = "0".padStart(difficulty, "0");
  console.log("Looking for a hash starting with", lookingFor);
  const duration = new Date().getTime() - start;

  while(!found){
    const possibleHash = createHash(block);  
    //does the hash start with zeroes?
    found = possibleHash.substring(0, difficulty) === lookingFor;
    if(found){
      block.hashKey = possibleHash;
      return block;
    }
    block.nonce += 1;
    //10 second kill switch
    if(duration > 10000) return "Didn't find it under 10s"
  }
}

const block = {
  transactions: [
    {from: "me", to: "you", amount: 10.00},
    {from: "you", to: "me", amount: 5.00}
  ],
  timestamp: 1609702546153, //if this changes the hash changes
  nonce: 0,
  previousKey: "00RSDThMVcQAvoocD3klO/6pjJ4a8pRbZ3ykk3XXhXE="
}
//let's see how long this takes
const start = new Date().getTime();
//let's do it!
const result = mine(block, 4);
const duration = new Date().getTime() - start;
console.log(`That took duration ${duration}ms`);
console.log(result);
```

And finally, our trip through the basics of RSA using super small primes:

```js
//resources
//https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html
//https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto/highlights/rsa-step-by-step
//let's find two relatively prime numbers, e and d, such that
//e % d mod r === 1
//this is the cornerstone of RSA
var findEandD = function(r) {
  //These are common candidates for e, which can be autoset
  //and typically 65537 is used, but we'll
  //start small for speed
  const possibleEs = [3n,5n,17n,257n,65537n]
  //now, loop over the possible e's so we can find our d
  for(let e of possibleEs){
    //we want to find a coprime for e, so let's factor it
    //up to r and see if e % r is 1
    //if it is, we found our coprime
    for (let d = 1n; d < r; d++) {
      const candidate = e * d;
      if (candidate % r == 1n) return {e: e, d: d};
    }
  }
  assert.fail("We shouldn't reach this point")
}

const p = 499n;
const q = 491n;
assert.notStrictEqual(p,q, "p and q must be different primes");

//our public key, N
const N = p * q;

//Euler's totient for deriving r
//r = phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
const r = (p-1n) * (q-1n);

//now we can calculate e and d for our private key
const {e,d} = findEandD(r);

//our message
const M = 25n;

console.log("e",e);
console.log("d",d);
console.log("N",N);
console.log("r",r);

console.log("M", M);

//the RSA algorithm
const encrypted = M**e % N;
const decrypted = encrypted**d % N;

console.log("Encrypted",encrypted);
console.log("Decrypted",decrypted);
```
