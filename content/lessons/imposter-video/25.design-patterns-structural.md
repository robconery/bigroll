Code needs to have some structure, so we use things like methods, modules, and classes. As code becomes more complex, these modules and classes might also need some structure to reduce confusion and unneeded complexity. That's what we'll take a look at here.

You can find the code for [each of the demos up on GitHub](https://github.com/imposters-handbook/videos/tree/master/patterns/structural).
