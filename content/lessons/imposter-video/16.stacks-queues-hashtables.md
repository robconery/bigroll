## Stacks

Stacks and Queues are basically linked lists with abstractions built in that let you retrieve data in a particular way. A stack, for instance, lets you "stack" data on to it but will only let you pull data off of the top - just like a stack of plates. The methods that you associate with a stack are `push` and `pop`: you "push" something onto the stack and "pop" off the top of the stack. This is also known as "Last In, First Out" or LIFO.

## Queues

A queue has the same kind of data access rule, but instead of popping off the top you can _only_ pull from the bottom of the queue, also known as "dequeuing". The two methods associated with a queue are `enqueue` and `dequeue` - just like waiting in line (or a queue) for a movie.

## Hash Tables

If you've worked with JavaScript objects in the past, you've worked with hash tables. They have a specific data access pattern: _you access each value with a particular key_. These objects are associated with a particular time complexity - do you know what that would be?
