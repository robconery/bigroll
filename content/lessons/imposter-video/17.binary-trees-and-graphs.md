In this video we'll get into the more complex data structures called "Graphs". The simplest graph is known as a tree and you likely know exactly what that is because you're used to looking for files in your computer - which are stored in a tree data structure.

There are different kinds of trees with different rules to them. We'll explore the common ones including the plain old tree and the binary tree - one that you'll probably have to use in your interview.
