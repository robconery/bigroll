We're getting deep into the theory now, aren't we! Al this talk about entropy and surprise... what good does it actually do us! Turns out - a lot!

Claude Shannon (yes, him again!) recognized the connection between entropy, surprise, redundancy (extra useless information) and efficiency. In this video we get into the math to show how you can restructure your message encoding using simple math and a very clever probability equation to perform lossless compression - that means stripping out needless 1s and 0s without losing any part of your message.
