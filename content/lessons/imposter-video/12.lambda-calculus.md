You use Lambda Calculus every day when you write code. Do you know how it works? As a programmer, understanding Lambda Calculus can enhance your skills but it is the very definition of _academic_.

## Pure Math

There are no numbers in Lambda Calculus - **only functions**. These functions are purely representative and it can bend your brain but then... _you get it_ and you start to realize just how fundamental these concepts are. Lambda Calculus is a pure joy to play with, but there is a bit of a learning curve.
