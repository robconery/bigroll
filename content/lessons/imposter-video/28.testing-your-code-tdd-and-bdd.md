I am, strictly speaking, not a practitioner of Test-driven Design, or TDD. I know what it is, and I know that people like to argue about what they think it is and what they think it is not.

Just show the essence of the idea. I think we can all agree on that, can't we? For this video I approached a number of friends and asked them about what they considered the essence of TDD to be, and how they think of using it. By the way – each of them hedged their opinions with a variation of "this isn't strictly TDD… but…".

**TDD requires discipline** and you're not alone if you sort of do it. As long as you're testing your code!

## The Code
