Firebase has been around for many years and is loved by many, including myself! With a little abstraction, it can be extremely helpful.

## Setting Up the Project at Firebase
We'll set things up and have a look around, then get the configuration bits so we can get our project going.

## Wiring Firebase to Our Project
We'll have the same issue we had with Supabase: Firebase is a _client only_ kind of thing, so let's make sure we get setup properly.

## Adding Authentication
It comes with Firebase, so let's add it in! We'll use the magic link, just like we are now.

## Adding Some Abstraction
We don't want Firebase "stuff" littered throughout the application, so let's make sure we abstract it somehow.

## Creating the Collections
Firebase is a document store but, just like Supabase, you need to build things with an API and rules in mind. Our focus: make it shallow and flat! We'll set up our seed to load up the documents.

## Applying Rules
Just like Supabase, we need to make sure that requests for data are locked down. This will inform how we structure out system.

## Setting Up Hosting and Shipping!
Unlike Supabase, Firebase has hosting with a free SSL cert. We'll set it up and then tune up our project for Firebase deployment.
