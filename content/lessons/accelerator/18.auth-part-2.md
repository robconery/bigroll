We took a good first stab at authentication using JWTs, now let's implement it! Things are bound to come up, pushing us to refine the API.

## Quick Checkin RE Prep and Notes
I've been trying to focus on the "real world walkthrough" angle and it's not easy. I do write things down and have "ready code" - let's see what that means.

 - Where the SMTP service came from
 - Doin it live?
 - I would love to hear from you

## Creating a Modal using Vuetify
The vision here is to allow the user to login from anywhere, using out `auth` store to hold their information and deal with our API.

 - Creating the modal
 - Adding the email, registration and code prompts
 - Handling success

## Refactor, If Needed!
I have a feeling I'll need to change a few things with the API, maybe not. We also need to discuss our JWT approach.
