In this episode things go very pear-shaped. I had _thought_ that I would be wrapping up Authorization completely, but I was absolutely wrong about that.

As a result, I lost the README notes due to my own haste, trying to get things to work. It doesn't matter anyway as I'm about to throw the whole thing out in the next episode.
