Let's tear through this episode, shall we! We already have the UI in place, we just need to flip over the data.

## Rolling in Videos
We're using local content for the lesson data, now let's roll in videos with Vimeo IDs.

 - Adding setters/getters for videos
 - Updating the course nav, progress and video components

## Checking For Completed
If we have time...

 - Adding setters/getters for completed
 - Updating the course nav, progress and videos with completed info
