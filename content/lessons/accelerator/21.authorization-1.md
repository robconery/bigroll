We can't escape it: we need a database! We have lots of choices but I'm going to go with what I would really do, so here we go!

## Considerations
How do we want to store our data and, more importantly, how should we get started?

 - Keep ignoring it and use something like `json-server`
 - Use a hosted system that's easy, like Supabase or Firebase
 - Roll up our sleeves and start building our models

I don't like the idea of writing code I know I'll throw away, so maybe we go with the 3rd option. Which leaves the question...

## Why Not Firebase or Supabase?
Short answer: these are great choices which I'll get into later, but only if you understand:

 - They replace your entire backend and API
 - Security rules! So easy to mess up.
 - They also replace your application state, in some ways (if you go full realtime)

## My User Code
I have some code ready to go that I added to the project and we'll walk through

## Sequelize Snippets

I use a few snippets for VS Code and here they are:

```json
"Sequelize TEXT": {
		"prefix": "mft",
		"body" : [
			"$0: DataTypes.TEXT,",
		]
	},
	"Sequelize field": {
		"prefix": "mf",
		"body" : [
			"$0: {",
			"  type: DataTypes.TEXT,",
			"  allowNull: false,",
			"},",
		]
	},
	"Sequelize money": {
		"prefix": "mfm",
		"body" : [
			"$0: {",
			"  type: \"numeric(10,2)\",",
			"  allowNull: false,",
			"  defaultValue: 0,",
			"},",
		]
	},
	"Sequelize Model" : {
		"prefix": "mod",
		"body" : [
			"const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');",
			"class $1 extends Model{}",
			"exports.init = function(sequelize){",
			"  $1.init({",
			"    $2: {",
			"      type: DataTypes.TEXT,",
			"      allowNull: false,",
			"      unique: true",
			"    },",
			"    }, {",
			"     sequelize,",
			"     underscored: true,",
			"     timestamps: false,",
			"     hooks : {",
			"       //https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/v6/src/hooks.js#L7",
			"    }",
			"  });",
			"  return { $1 };",
			"}",
		]
	}
```
