I'm a big fan of testing things - especially end-to-end (e2e). Let's see how Playwright can help us automate our login and video checks.

The focus will be: _great, but how do I actually use this thing?_

## Off Camera
Setup a test user with Supabase and a new login page (I have to) as we have no way to authenticate our user otherwise.

## Setting Up Playwright
We'll do the needful and see how Playwright works:

 - Install Playwright, showing both ways (VS Code Extension and CLI)
 - Look through the config, tweaking to make it a bit more usable
 - Have a gander at the examples
 - Understand how Locaters work and what makes UI testing so brittle

## Authentication Issues
Our tests need to know who the user is, so we'll plug in authentication and discuss how this would work in automated tests (it won't and shouldn't)

## Running Tests
Lots of ways to run tests:

 - VS Code Extension (don't like)
 - The CLI (it's OK)
 - The UI tool (it's great)

## Rob's Opinion
I have lots of opinions on tests and testing, and I'm happy to share

## Snippets
I have a number of snippets I like to use because I like to write tests by hand. Hope you find them useful!

```json
"Playwright":{
		"prefix": "pw",
		"body": [
			"const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\r\n",
			"test.describe(\"$1\", () => {",
			"\ttest.beforeEach(async ({page}) => {",
			"\t\tawait page.goto('')",
			"\t});",
			"\ttest(\"$2\", async ({page}) => {",
			"\t\t$0",
			"\t});",
			"});"
		]
	},
	"Playwright describe" : {
		"prefix": "pwd",
		"body": [
			"test.describe(\"$1\", () => {",
			"  $0",
			"});"
		]
	},
	"Playwright label" : {
		"prefix": "pwlbl",
		"body": [
			"const $0 = await page.getByLabel(\"$1\");"
		]
	},
	"Playwright id" : {
		"prefix": "pwid",
		"body": [
			"const $0 = await page.locator(\"#$1\");"
		]
	},
	"Playwright test id" : {
		"prefix": "pwtid",
		"body": [
			"const $0 = await page.getByTestId(\"$1\");"
		]
	},
	"Playwright role" : {
		"prefix": "pwrole",
		"body": [
			"const $0 = await page.getByRole('$1', { name: '$2' });"
		]
	},
```
