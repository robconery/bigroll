Woohoo! Let's get off the ground quickly as there are hours upon hours of video to watch.

## This is a casual watch
I put this together so you could watch it like you might a Netflix documentary. Feel free to play along, but what I'm hoping for is the feel of a pair coding session, where you watch someone build something and see the decisions they make and why.

If you want to follow along, please do!

## Editor and Browser
I'm using VS Code throughout with the Vue 3 (Volar) extension as well as Playwright later on.

## Feedback
I don't think things are ever "done" so if you want to let me know your opinion or have a request, hit that GitHub button in the menu!
