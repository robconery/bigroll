We're going to get called into an unscheduled demo - count on it. Make your work shine before it happens! Plus: it drives us to completion!

## Adding a logo
I did this off camera but I'll walk you through some ideas

 - Find yourself a design app you trust
 - Some helpful resources

## Setting colors
Videos are much easier to watch on a dark background as light backgrounds can cause eyestrain over time. Plus, it makes the video pop!

 - Adding gradient coloring to the lesson
 - Calling out the text
 - Adding complementary colors to the nav bits (side, top, and bottom)

## The progress bar
We don't have the data for it just yet - but let's plugin a quick progress bar as an accent!
