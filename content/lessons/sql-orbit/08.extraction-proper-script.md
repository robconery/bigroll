If we try to run our import script twice we're going to get an error because the schema already exists - as does our table. We _could_ check to see if these things exist first, but it's much easier just to hose everything and rerun.

To do that, we need to drop everything first. We can also avoid errors by ensuring the `drop` only happens if the schema exists first:

```sql
drop schema if exists csvs cascade;
```

That cascade keyword will drop the target object _and all dependent objects_ on it.
