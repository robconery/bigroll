summary: "Our first task is to find the exact dates and times when Cassini flew by Enceladus and made its measurements. We need to create a time window so we can narrow down the results from the INMS - Cassini's on board Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer - that's the thing that sniffed space for the chemicals we're looking for. Off we go!"

When importing data into Postgres from a CSV, it's imperative that you _do not try to alter the data_ - do that by explicitly transforming the data later on.

That means we need to import everything as `text`, because that's the core string type in Postgres (as opposed to `text` etc).

To create our schema and table:

```sql
create schema csvs;
create table csvs.master_plan(
  start_time_utc text,
  duration text,
  date text,
  team text,
  spass_type text,
  target text,
  request_name text,
  library_definition text,
  title text,
  description text
);
```

Copying data from a CSV into our new table:

```sql
copy csvs.master_plan
from '[Absolute path to]/csvs/master_plan.csv'
delimiter ',' header csv;
```
