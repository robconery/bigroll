slug: flybys-intro
summary: "We have our tools and our initial extraction ready to go, now let's get to work finding the flybys of Enceladus! In this section we'll focus on transforming this data into something we can query with some degree of confidence and then, hopefully, we'll find the exact time windows for the flybys."

The data is loaded up, now let's roll up our DBA sleeves and get to work! We'll start by creating a workspace:

```bash
mkdir enceladus
touch enceladus/load.sql
```
