The date information in our imported data looks a little strange, with a timestamp that's formatted as `year-dayofyear`, a duration, and a weird column named `date` that's formatted in a pretty simplistic way.

We can validate that the timestamp format won't cause problems by running a simple query, casting it to an ISO string:

```sql
select start_time_utc::timestamp from csvs.master_plan;
```

That will throw if the conversion won't work.

You can reconcile two fields of data by running a simple comparison. The trick, however, is to be sure they're the same type, and we can do that by casting (`::`) both to a `date`:

```sql
select start_time_utc from csvs.master_plan
where start_time_utc::date <> date::date;
```
