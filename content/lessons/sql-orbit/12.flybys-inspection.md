To see a description of a table in Postgres, we use the "describe" command followed by the object we want described: `\d csvs.master_plan`. 

We're trying to isolate the Enceladus plan data, so for that we can use a simple `select` statement with a `where` clause. There's a lot of data in there and we don't want it all back, so we can limit the result using `limit`:

```sql
select team, spass_type, target 
from csvs.master_plan 
where target='Enceladus' limit 10;
```

This equality predicate (`where target='Enceladus'`) is case sensitive and very strict - it has to be an exact match. We'd like a more "fuzzy" search, so we can use a matching regular expression in our predicate with the `~*` operator:

```sql
select team, spass_type, target 
from csvs.master_plan 
where target ~* 'Enceladus' limit 10;
```

That's a case _insensitive_ match. If we wanted a case sensitive matching expression we could use `~`:

```sql
select team, spass_type, target 
from csvs.master_plan 
where target ~ 'Enceladus' limit 10;
```

Many times you'll want to isolate the distinct values of a column. This can be to check if there are spelling/casing issues OR to isolate data in order to create a separate table. You can do this using `distinct`:

```sql
select distinct target from csvs.master_plan order by target;
```

To figure out how many total records we have matching our `where` predicate we can use `count`:

```sql
select count(1) from csvs.master_plan where target ~* 'Enceladus';
```

You can make your `where` predicate more exclusive by adding `and`. This query is using the Postgres case-insensitive "fuzzy" keyword `ilike`, which accepts a wildcard `%` that says "show me all the rows where the target is Enceladus and the title starts with the characters `flyby`:

```sql
select start_time_utc, title 
from csvs.master_plan where target='Enceladus'
AND title ilike 'flyby%';
```

We want something a little more fuzzy, however, because we don't know if the title will actually _start_ with the term `flyby` - that means we want something that _contains_ the word `flyby`. We can, once again, use a regular expression for this, without the wildcard:

```sql
select start_time_utc, title 
from csvs.master_plan where target='Enceladus'
AND title ~* 'flyby';
```
