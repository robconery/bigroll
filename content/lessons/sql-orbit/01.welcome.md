Many programmers are resistant to learning SQL, which is unfortunate! Learning this simple language can help you in so, so many ways, including:

- **Sleuthing and problem solving!** You'll be the go-to person when that ORM that your project is using just can't get the job done.
- **Career Security**. Let's face it, the database person on any project typically has the least to worry about when it comes to keeping their jobs. It's an incredibly important position!
- **It's just plain fun**. Working with data is one of the most joyful things you can do as a developer. Just ask any DBA!

I started my career as the "go-to" data person at a large environmental company. I kind of fell backwards into it, working with Microsoft Access and then SQL Server. I learned database theory on the fly and mastered SQL quickly - a language that I still use routinely.
