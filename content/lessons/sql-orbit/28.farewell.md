We did a bunch of work in this video! How fun! We learned all about the INMS and the data it collected. We also dove into joins and learned how inner, left, right and full joins can tell entirely different stories. We discussed the ethical side of things - and there's a LOT more to discuss on that front - but we covered the essentials that you'll need to remember as a developer/dba. Finally - we shipped our data in the form of CVSs!

We learned some very useful SQL including join syntax and what it means. We created more aggregate queries once again using group by and some new, and old functions. We created a materialized view to speed up our analysis queries and finally we exported our results using COPY to.

Thank you so much for watching, I really hope you enjoyed this production!
