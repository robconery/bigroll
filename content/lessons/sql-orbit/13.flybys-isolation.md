We'll start by creating a script to _transform_ the imported data into something we can analyze later on. For that, we'll use bash:

```sh 
mkdir enceladus #if you haven't already
touch enceladus/transform.sql
```

Once again, we'll create a schema to work in, but this time we'll ensure the script is idempotent from the start. As a convenience, we'll tell Postgres that every bit of SQL that's to come is to be run in the `enceladus` schema. We can do that by setting the `search_path`:

```sql 
drop schema if exists enceladus cascade;
create schema enceladus;
set search_path='enceladus';
```

Creating our `teams` and `plans` table, which are related by a _foreign key_, which is the `team_id` in the `plans` table. It `references` the `id` of the `teams` table. We specify that using the keyword `references`:

```sql
drop schema if exists enceladus cascade;
create schema enceladus;
set search_path='enceladus';

create table teams(
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);

create table plans(
  id serial primary key,
  start timestamp not null,
  title text not null,
  team_id int not null references teams(id),
  description text
);
```

Now we need to add some data and we can do that using a new SQL friend, `insert`. You can `insert` data in two ways: using the results of a query or by creating a set of hard-coded values. We'll use a query:

```sql
insert into teams(name)
select distinct team from csvs.master_plan;

insert into plans(start, title, team_id, description)
select 
  start_time_utc::timestamp,
  title,
  (select id from teams where name=csvs.master_plan.team),
  description
from csvs.master_plan
where target='Enceladus' and title is not null;

```
