The word _bias_ might sound a bit strong when describing the use of joins. It's important to note, however, that bias can take two forms: _implicit_ and _explicit_. I dislike brussel sprouts and will never eat them (unless they're wrapped in bacon and then they're tolerable). This is an _explicit_ bias and I know it!

Implicit bias can take many forms that we're simply not aware of, including a lack of knowledge or experience. It also takes the form of unseen preferences which, in the programming world can come down to the languages you use, the editors you write in and even the music you listen to while writing that code in that editor!

We're going to see how implicit bias can change the story our data tells. It will seem subtle - but that's exactly the point...

## Left, Right, Full Outer Joins

In this example we work with a _many to many_ join. One person can have many jobs, and one job can have many people. Notice the composite primary key on `assignments`. This is a common primary key for joining tables. The primary key is defined by two columns instead of one, the combination of each _must be unique_:

```sql
create table people(
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);

create table jobs(
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);

create table assignments(
  people_id int not null references people(id),
  job_id int not null references jobs(id),
  primary key(people_id, job_id) -- composite primary key
);

insert into people(name)
values('Darth Vader'),('Apple Dumpling'),('Duke Leto'),('Totoro');

insert into jobs(name)
values('Control the Galaxy'),('Bake Apple Pies'),
      ('Rule Arrakis'),('Play shakuhatchi in tree');

insert into assignments(people_id, job_id)
values
	(1,1),(1,2),
	(2,2),(2,4),
	(4,4),(4,1);
```

Querying this data involves joining the tables together. We can do this _exclusively_, meaning only data that fits our join condition (`people_id = people.id` for instance) will be included:

```sql
select * from people -- from left...
inner join assignments on people_id = people.id
inner join jobs on jobs.id = assignments.job_id; -- to right
```

We can loosen things up a bit using a `left` or `left outer` join (same thing). Show me all data to the left of the join. In this query, we'll see all people but `null` for jobs without people:

```sql
select * from people --all data coming from here
left outer assignments on people_id = people.id -- and here...
left outer jobs on jobs.id = assignments.job_id; -- only matching from here
```

This can work in the other direction, to the _right_ of the join as well. Here we'll see all the jobs but `null` for people without jobs:

```sql
select * from people -- only matching from here
right outer assignments on people_id = people.id -- and here...
right outer jobs on jobs.id = assignments.job_id; --all data coming from here
```

If we want to see absolutely everything, we use a `full outer` join:

```sql
select * from people --all data coming from here
full outer assignments on people_id = people.id -- and here...
full outer jobs on jobs.id = assignments.job_id; --all data coming from here
```

This shows us everything, including jobs without people and people without jobs.

We can also do a _many to many_ join with two tables, one of them referencing itself. This looks weird, but it implies a completely different type of relationship (bidirectional):

```sql
-- drop our existing tables
drop table if exists people cascade;
drop table if exists jobs cascade;
drop table if exists assignments cascade;

create table people(
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);

create table friends(
  people_id int not null,
  friend_id int not null references people(id),
  primary key (people_id, friend_id) -- a composite primary key
);

insert into people(name)
values
	('Darth Vader'),
	('Apple Dumpling'),
	('Duke Leto'),
	('Totoro');
insert into friends(people_id, friend_id)
values
	(1,3),(1,4), -- Vader/Leto, Vader/Totoro
	(2,4),(3,4); -- Apple Dumpling/Totoro, Duke Leto/Totoro
```

Querying this gets interesting - what is it we hope to understand? The obvious answer is "who's friends with whom", but what will the result set look like? Also, do we care about people _without_ friends?

If we're only interested in showing friends, we can query it like this:

```sql
select people.name, friendos.name from people
inner join friends on people.id = friends.people_id
inner join people as friendos on friends.friend_id = friendos.id; -- alias the people table to avoid naming collisions
```

This exclusive result set is what we're looking for as showing a more detailed result set (using `left`, `right` or `full`) would cause duplication. In other words, we'd see `Vader/Leto` and `Leto/Vader`. Friendship is kind of a mutual thing and all we need to see is a single result to define the idea.

## The Bias Discussion

In that last paragraph I just defined what friendship means and created a table design and query based on my thoughts and beliefs about friendship. Do you trust me to accurately do this? Do you trust yourself? What kinds of questions might arise from this data set in the future?

The answer is _awareness_. It's yet another reason we write down everything in our README file so people understand what decisions we've made and why. If you have a team to discuss things with, do!
