summary: "Excel is EVERYWHERE and for good reason - it's simple to use, you can visualize data and you can even write simple functions and macros. Excel is the powerhouse of the analytical world and we need to prepare our data to work with it."

We've been asked to assemble two queries for export: the chemical data gathered per flyby and the chemical data found over the entirety of the Cassini mission. We can do that using these queries:

```sql
set search_path='enceladus';
select flybys.name as flyby,
	inms.date,
	inms.source,
	chemistry.name as compound,
	chemistry.formula,
	sum(inms.high_sensitivity_count) as sum_high,
	sum(inms.low_sensitivity_count) as sum_low
from flybys
inner join inms on flyby_id = flybys.id
inner join chemistry on chemistry.molecular_weight = inms.mass
group by flybys.name, inms.date, inms.source, chemistry.name, chemistry.formula;
```

To speed things up (and uncramp our fingers) we'll create a _materialized view_. Notice how I'm dropping the view if it exists and then recreating it directly. This keeps our script _idempotent_, which is required:

```sql
set search_path='enceladus';
drop materialized view if exists results_per_flyby;
create materialized view results_per_flyby as
select flybys.name,
  flybys.date,
  inms.source,
  chemistry.name as compound,
  chemistry.formula,
  sum(inms.high_sensitivity_count) as sum_high,
  sum(inms.low_sensitivity_count) as sum_low
from flybys
inner join inms on flyby_id = flybys.id
inner join chemistry on chemistry.molecular_weight = inms.mass
group by flybys.name, flybys.date, inms.source, chemistry.name, chemistry.formula
order by flybys.date;
```

The overall query is a bit simpler as all we need to do is remove the `flybys` table from the `select`, `join` and `group by` list:

```sql
select
  inms.source,
  chemistry.name as compound,
  chemistry.formula,
  sum(inms.high_sensitivity_count) as sum_high,
  sum(inms.low_sensitivity_count) as sum_low
from flybys
inner join inms on flyby_id = flybys.id
inner join chemistry on chemistry.molecular_weight = inms.mass
group by inms.source, chemistry.name, chemistry.formula)
```
