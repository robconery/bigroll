This is a basic string manipulation question that I made Jon do on a Google document, far away from Visual Studio. Not only that, he had to use .NET 1.1.

In this question, I asked Jon to create a routine that would check an array of words. His job was to evaluate each word and decide which were anagrams of the others. Not only that, but this time he doesn't get to use his IDE - I made him use a Google document and then, at the end, I made him check to see if it would compile...

Hereâ€™s the question:

> Given an array of strings, return the strings that are anagrams.
