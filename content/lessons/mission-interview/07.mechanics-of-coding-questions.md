OK let's see if you're chilled out and focused enough to tackle the tougher problems ahead. In this video I'm going to walk you through the dumbest of interview questions **but I'm going to do it from the perspective of the interviewer**. 

It's critical that you understand what it is they're trying to find out and how they'll use these questions to dig into your problem solving abilities.

And here's a super critical tip: _almost no one gets these things right the first time_. As you're about to see - the goal is not to get the question right, it's to show the interviewer how you approach and try to solve a problem.

Here's another super critical tip: **people that aren't qualified for a job get the most defensive and angry**. Your interviewer will be looking for this!
