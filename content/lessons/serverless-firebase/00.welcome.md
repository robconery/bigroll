summary: "These videos have been 3 years in the making! I started this project in the spring of 2014 with a simple idea: what could I build without having to manage a server? The results were interesting, but not overly compelling. I wanted to SELL THINGS, and doing that by knitting together various services was a pain. Then came serverless and Firebase - let's get started!"
