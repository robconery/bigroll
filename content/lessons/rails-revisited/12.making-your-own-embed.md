Spina gives you a generator that lets you add embeddable content as you need. It comes with the most common, including YouTube, Vimeo, and a Button. You might want to do something more complex, like adding a GitHub gist, which is what we cover in this video.  
You can get started with:

```
rails g spina:embed gist url
```

This creates a model, a form, and your HTML output.
