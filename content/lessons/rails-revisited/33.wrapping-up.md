In this final video I'll take a look back at my effort to rebuild my Nuxt sites with a single Rails application. Creatively and technically, I will say that it was very worth it to me. The speed and simplicity of Rails made this a joyous process.

From a business perspective, no way! I should be focusing on producing content, not rebuilding my stuff.

Good thing I'm not all about business, otherwise I wouldn't have nearly as much fun!
