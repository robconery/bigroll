There are two ways to work with Rails' scaffolds. You can create one with a name and the fields that you need:

```
rails g scaffold customer first_name last_name email:uniq company address city state country
postal_code phone fax  --no-migration --no-jbuilder
```

And you can destroy what you've done by using `destroy`:

```
rails destroy scaffold customer
```

I created a scripts directory with two scaffold files in there as I found that I would create a scaffold, need to add some data or schema changes, and then redo it. This happened often, and so I made sure I knew what I was doing by recording the scaffolds in these tables.

## Flexing Magical Rails Restful Routes

The "Big 7" in Rails are `index` `show` `edit` `new` `create` `update` `delete`. When you scaffold a resource, these routes (and their views) are generated for you, and all you need to do is alter them to suit your needs. This is mostly with the `index` and `show` routes, which the user will see (if you let them). The other routes are for admins to manipulate the data.
