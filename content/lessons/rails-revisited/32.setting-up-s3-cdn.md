Setting up S3 is a matter of uncommenting some settings in your config/storage.yml file:

```yaml
amazon:
  service: S3
  access_key_id: <%=ENV.fetch("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")%>
  secret_access_key: <%= ENV.fetch("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY") %>
  region: us-west-1
  bucket: bigrails
  public: true
```

You then need to set config/environments/production.rb to use the amazon provider:

```ruby
config.active_storage.service = :amazon
```
