We're given a new application layout in a directory called "default", inside our layouts directory. Spina put that file there, and it's kind of confusing as to what to do next.

## The Problem

The editor that we're working with, called Trix, is only generating vanilla HTML tags with no classes applied, which means we can't use Tailwind with our Trix editor. This is OK, as there are a few workarounds:

- We tweak tailwind.css, and apply default styling to H1, H2, p, and other tags.
- We don't use Trix to style a page, only _sections_ of a page. In other words: it does rich content, that's it. Nothing structural.

I go with the latter in the next video.
