We have many playlists, we have many tracks. How do we assign a track to a playlist using our Rails forms? Turns out, it's pretty easy:

```erb
 <h2 class="text-2xl mt-2">Playlists</h2>
  <table>
    <%=form.collection_check_boxes(:playlist\_ids, Playlist.all, :id, :name) do |b| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= b.check_box %></td>
        <td><%= b.label %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </table>
```
