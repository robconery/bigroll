Installing Spina is a matter of adding a gem and then running a few commands:

```
bundle add spina
rails active\_storage:install
rails spina:install
```

You'll see a load of files being installed, most of which are migrations. At the very end you'll get a few prompts to name your app, add your email, and finally a password.

**Note:**Â If you get an error running spina::install, be sure to specify the version in your `Gemfile`, for instance

```
gem "spina", "~> 2.18
```
