## The Code

Running the site in development mode, ensuring that CSS gets compiled as we need:

```
bin/dev
```

Rendering a partial:

```erb
<%=render("directory/partial") %>
```

It's important to remember that partials start with an underscore, but you don't use it when you call render.  
When defining a route, you start with the HTTP verb, the matcher, and then the **controller#action** pair:

get 'about', to: "home#about"
