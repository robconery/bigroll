Installing [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) requires some effort on your part, which includes:

```
bundle add devise
```

Next, run the installer, which will add the initializer as well as the localization bits:

```
rails generate devise:install
```

You can find the initializer (with config settings) inside `config/initializers/devise.rb`. Our next task is to associate (or create) the model that Devise will work with:

```
rails generate devise User
```

If you don't have a `User` model, Devise will create one for you. Otherwise, it will add stuff to your existing model. Have a look and see the settings in there, and also make sure your migration aligns with whatever you choose (`trackable`, `confirmable`, etc).

Finally, we need to output the views so we can tweak them:

```
rails g devise:views
```

Make sure you run your migrations, and off you go!
