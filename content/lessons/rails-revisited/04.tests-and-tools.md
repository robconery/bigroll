Not so much code in this one, but some shortcuts:

```
mkdir scripts
touch .env
touch Makefile
```

The Makefile itself is pretty sparse, but you'll add to it as you need. The idea is to put things here that you run often, like starting the server, running tests, etc.

```make
run:
  bin/serve

test:
  rails test

.PHONY: run test
```
