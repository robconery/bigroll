Rails is helpful when it comes to providing a positive experience for your user, and one of those helpful things is to not make any changes with a simple GET request, such as logging someone out. To that end, we need to figure out how we can comply with this notion without writing a bunch of code! Thankfully, it's straightforward:

```erb
<%= button_to "Logout", destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete, data: {turbo: false} %>
```

OK, maybe that's not entirely straightforward! We have to use `button_to` because the `link_to` helper will only create an `anchor` tag, which fires a `GET` request. The `button_to` helper will create a form for us with the correct method. By adding data: `{turbo: false}`, we're also turning off turbo links, which can mess with the form submission.

The next task is overriding the base controller with our own (`controllers/users/passwordless_controller.rb`):

```ruby
class Users::PasswordlessController < Devise::Passwordless::SessionsController
  def create
    if params[:user].nil? || params[:user][:email].nil?
      return redirect_to new_user_session_path, alert: "Please enter an email address"
    end
    user = User.find_by(email: params[:user][:email])
    unless user
      user = User.create(email: params[:user][:email])
    end
    user.send_magic_link
    redirect_to new_user_session_path, notice: "Magic link sent!"
  end
end
```
