You might have existing styling for your pages, which is great! Hopefully we can reuse it. What we need, however, are the pages themselves (or "views" in the Rails world). Let's have Rails generate the things we need, for all of our tables (well, most of them anyway).  
We'll fill out the scaffold script files and have at it!
